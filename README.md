# SMART Tests

You should also configure your smart tests otherwise the script will not include smart test results and will generate an additional error unless you checked `Hide Standard Error` in the cron job.


# Getting Started

Place the script under a user `/home/user` or in one of your pools.

Create a Cron Job with the following configuration:

```
Description: Run Smart Report
Command: /path/to/script/report.sh -c /path/to/script/report.cfg
Run as: root
Schedule: Daily
Hide Standard Output: **Checked**
Hide Standard Error: **Unchecked**
Enabled: **Checked**
```

Click `Submit` and then `Run Now`.

A configuration file will be generated at `/path/to/script/report.cfg`

**At a minimum, enter an email address for the report to be sent to and set `defaultFile` to `0` in the generated config file. Feel free to edit other user parameters as needed. Backup has been disabled by default so if it is required please set to true.**

Once you have updated the config file, click `Run Now` again to generate your first report.
